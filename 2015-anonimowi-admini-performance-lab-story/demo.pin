You start by writing down the core concepts that you will be talking about. Then sort and format
them as a pinpoint presentation in a text editor of your choice. 

If this was a presentation given as a demonstration of pinpoint you would now be trying to read
this slide as well as pay attention to what is said. Less than ideal.

Pinpoint reloads the presentation when it changes on disk, very useful when you're tuning things
so keep both pinpoint and your text editor open. And remember, the less text you have, the happier
your audience will be ;-)
