# Ghost in the shell #

Terminal - based working environment. Easy to use and secures your privacy.

## What's this about? ##

There was this event called [IT night](http://nocinformatyka.pl/) where I gave
talk *Ghost in the shell*. I talked about working and living in terminal (you
can vies slides on
[Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/d0cent/ghost-intheshell)). Afterwards
some guys asked me a couple of questions and also I got couple of e-mails with
interesting ideas how to develop this whole terminal - based environment
keeping privacy as the very important and making sure that installation of
components is very easy (Ansible & Docker ftw) and usability is very good.

So this is it - there is still no clear view how we're gonna develop this
project; we need couple of meetings to settle things down (AA & Infosec meetups
@Krk). For now you can star this project and follow #gitsterm tag on Twitter
(as GhostInTheShellTerm lol ;) ).
