    - concurrency
        - no concurrency? no issues
        - scaling is really easy
    - architecture & templates? 3 ways:
        - low - level
        - classic:
            - webserver? express
            - client-server / MVC? Backbone
            - push? Socket.IO
            - templates? swig

    - basic JS considerations
        - classical approach: 
            - JS is for children - wrong!
            - JS is slow - wrong! (v8)
            - JS is not scalable - wrong! (see frameworks)
            - JS is insecure - wrong! (unless you really don't know it)
            - etc... wrong! ;)

        - express for the resscue
            - basic auth
            - could be done also with SSL keys (but really? perf bad!)

- scalability & perf
    - c10k problem: http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html
    - clusters
    - from paypal / release the kracken:
        - team scalability: node.js programming is much faster! PayPal: 2 vs 12
        - lower response times!
        - double the requests / second
    - containers ftw
    - resources management
- what more?
    - backbone.js:
    - swig - loved jinja2? you'll love swig
- would you like to know more?
